# AreThereGays

WIP:
This project was conceptualized by members of the Bucknell GSA. The idea is to create a database that keeps track of LGBTQ representation in 
TV and Film. The website will work by polling the OMDB api ( http://www.omdbapi.com/ ) to bring up information about movies and a unique key
then they user will be polled on if there is representation in the film and a score will be updated for each movie.
